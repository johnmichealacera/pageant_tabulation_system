## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL database (or use SQLite for development)

### Installation

1. Clone or navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd pageant-tabulation-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/pageant_db"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"

# Cloudinary Configuration (for image uploads)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_URL="https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/your-cloud-name/image/upload"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET="your-upload-preset"
```

4. Set up the database:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

5. Seed the database with sample data:
```bash
npm run db:seed
```

6. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🖥️ Desktop Offline Build (Electron)

This project now supports an offline Windows desktop build using Electron, while keeping the cloud deployment workflow intact.

### What the desktop build includes
- Local SQLite database (pre-seeded)
- Offline authentication and scoring
- Local image uploads to an `uploads/` folder
- Windows executable in `dist/win-unpacked/`

### Build command
```bash
npm run electron:build
```

### Output
- `dist/win-unpacked/` - full Windows app folder (recommended for distribution)
- `dist/Pageant-Tabulation-System-Windows.tar.gz` - compressed package of the app folder

### Run on Windows
1. Copy `dist/win-unpacked/` to the Windows machine.
2. Open the folder.
3. Run `Pageant Tabulation System.exe`.

### Notes for WSL/Linux builders
- If building from WSL/Linux, install Wine first for Windows packaging support.
- The build script restores the normal PostgreSQL Prisma client after each desktop build so cloud development remains unaffected.

### SmartScreen warning (Windows protected your PC)
Unsigned `.exe` files can trigger SmartScreen on first run. This is expected for student/internal builds.
